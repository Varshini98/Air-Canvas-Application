# Air-Canvas-Application
a real-time video-based pointing system for drawing/writing in front of the camera.  Air writing canvas on this paper allows us to write on open space using a colored fingertip. The user places the color marker on the tip of their fingers. This aids the camera in recognizing hand motions. Used python programming to do this (OpenCV).
